  : Research Ecologist, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division, Narragansett, RI
  
      - I serve as principle investigator and provide leadership to the division on landscape ecological research, on application of geospatial sciences to the understanding of water quality in fresh and estuarine waters, and on the use of informatics and information management tools in environmental research. In this role, I have developed tools and methodologies (GIS and statistical) using numerous software packages and languages (R, ArcGIS, GRASS, Python, MS Excel) and have continued prior research on technology transfer of data, analytical methods and predictive tools to Northeast States; and developed statistical and modeling tools to facilitate use of defensible techniques in water quality criteria development. Previously I have: served as Co-lead on a project studying ecosystem services related to nutrient cycling in Northeastern lakes and ponds, was the liaison between the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and EPA’s Ecosystem Services Research Program (ESRP), was task lead for our lakes ecosystem services work, and served as co-task lead for developing decision support tools for a project in Narragansett Bay and its watershed. I am currently serving as a co-Task Lead on a project exploring cyanobacteria risk in lakes of the Northeastern US. I am also exploring the use of Open Science, data science, and computational ecology in our various research programs.

  : R  
  
      - I started using R in 2003 for data analysis and have been using it daily for basic computing and programming tasks since 2011.  I have created packages with four on CRAN ([quickmapr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quickmapr/index.html), [lakemorpho](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lakemorpho/index.html), [elevatr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/elevatr/index.html), and [lawn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lawn/index.html)) and several in development on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhollist). I co-moderate (with Sarah Goslee) the R-SIG-Ecology mailing list, and have taught several classes/workshops on R.  I am the lead maintainer of [rOpenSci's Maptools CRAN Taskview](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools), I contribute to both the development of [lawn: an R client for turf.js](https://github.com/ropensci/lawn) and the [Reproducibility Guide](http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/).
  
  : Web
  
      - Although not a web designer, I have served as a web page maintainer for various organizations since ~2000.  Currently I maintain my own website and a few small project websites.

The prior 17 years I extensively used the ESRI product line including ArcGIS, Arc/INFO, ArcView, ArcIMS and ArcGIS Server, and Geostatistical Analyst.  I have limited experience using GRASS.  
  
  : Statistics
  
      - My statistics work has been conducted primarily in R since 2003.  I have experience with many many statistical methods including least squares, logistic regression, information theoretic model selection, principal components, multi-dimensional scaling, boosted regression, and Random Forests.  In the past I have used SAS, SPSS, SPlus, and SigmaPlot.
  
  : Data
  
      - I have many years experience managing small to medium-sized research datasets.  I have done this using relational databases (Access, SQLite), flat files, and for spatial data, shapefiles, coverages, File Geodatabases, and recently GeoJSON.  
  
  : Remote Sensing
  
      - I have experience analyzing aerial photography and satellite imagery to develop land use/land cover classifications and used a variety of accuracy assessment methods and approaches.  Must of my past remote sensing work was conducted with ERDAS Imagine.
