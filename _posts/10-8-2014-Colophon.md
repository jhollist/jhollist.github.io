Hard to believe that in less than a year I am now on my third version of my website.  First one was me hacking at bootstrap.  I knew next to nothing then, but was able to get a minimal site up and running. Since then I have learned quite a bit more about web design, Jekyll, hosting on [github](https://github.com/jhollist), and am a much better hacker than I was then (although still not a good one).  My second site never really saw the light of day and was developed from scratch for a web design course I took.  

This third site is now being hosted with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github](https://github.com/jhollist/jhollist.github.io) using a slightly customized version of the [Hyde theme](http://andhyde.com/).  Hyde is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/poole/hyde/LICENSE.md), and the content on my website is freely available via [Creatitve Commons Zero Public Domain Declaration](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).  I would have used [WTFPL v2.0](http://www.wtfpl.net/), but some might take offense.

I will likely keep hacking on this site by adding some additional styling components and content (i.e. my CV).  I do also plan on blogging some here when I get the time.  I expect to maintain my [old blog](http://landeco2point0.wordpress.com/) as an archive but new content will go here.  Any technical changes will be added to this post.
