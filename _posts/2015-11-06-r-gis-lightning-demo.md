At this years [NEARC](http://northeastarc.org/2015/index.html) meeting I decided to give a lightning talk on using R as a GIS.  As I was working on this I thought, "why not try a lightning demo?"  That would be better than five minutes of slides on packages and commands.  But, as anyone who has done a live demo will know, they often provide unexpected challenges.  Add a 5 minute limit to that, and well, some level of failure is sure to occur.  Becuase of this I have decided put everything into a web page so that the attendees (and others) can access the full demo at a later date.  The full text and code is at <http://jwhollister.com/rgis_lightning_demo>.
